    The books currently most actively developed by the VedaLoka publishing house follow the principle of a rising staircase. In these books, Swami Avadhut — a person with a vast worldview and extensive experience in various areas of life — builds a path for a broad audience, starting from the simplest, most relatable topics and leading to the profound roots of diverse phenomena of the modern world.

    The highest goal of this captivating work is to help people navigate through the modern maze of superficial meanings and reach the core — that which can make each life happy and filled with love. This is fully revealed in the world's most ancient source of knowledge — the Vedas. Swami Avadhut has been studying, practicing, and sharing this knowledge for over thirty years. And he does this not only through books and lectures but also through immersive exhibitions, spiritual festivals, and diverse multimedia content.

    We also work on translating and publishing Vedic texts themselves. Our most important current project in this field is the *Bhagavad Gita* with nearly a dozen commentaries by great teachers of the past.

    You can become an integral part of this educational mission by joining the team of editors, translators, and specialists from various fields. Rest assured, there is a place on this team for anyone who sincerely seeks truth, the world, and their place within it.
